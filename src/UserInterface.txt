Have two drop down menus. One will have the "from" conversion and the other will have a "to" conversion.
There will be a "convert" button that will make the conversion and make the "to" measurement show up in a textfield
Have a disclaimer when converting from weight to volume that says that conversion is from weight to volume so the
measurement will be an approximation. Make sure to catch any input/output exceptions or number format exceptions and
pop up a dialogue box when that is encountered. When making the user interface, if a measurement is converted to
teaspoons or tablespoons then check if the decimal is about equal to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 so that you can show
that fraction measurment in the output (that is better for the user than comparing the decimal conversion value to
a fraction manually).

Note to self: 07/22
I started making the conversion on the GUI but then realized that not every 'from' conversion had corresponding
'to' conversions for every single conversions. So I need to update the toComboBox depending on what is picked
for the fromComboBox. I was able to update the toComboBox but the issue is that now, the action listener empties
the toComboBox and gives it correct values when selecting a value in fromComboBox but it erases the toComboBox
again when pressing the 'convert' button, since the fromComboBox and the button have the same action listener.
Then I attempted to make another class that handles the restructuring of the toComboBox depending on what value
is selected in the fromComboBox. Now there is a bug since that action listener works but it always thinks that
'Select' is the value in fromComboBox, regardless if another value is selected after the GUI is launched. I need
to fix that bug in order to proceed with the program. After that, I can comfortably make the conversions and finish
the project. Remember to add a simple instructions label at the bottom telling the user to 1. Enter the measurement
2. choose what unit of measure it is and 3. What unit of measure to convert to. Maybe include an example but that is
towards the end of the project. The classes I modified were UserInterface (slightly), Handler, ToComboBox (but I
think that one is irrelevent at this point), and I made the ComboBoxHandler class to change the toComboBox
depending on what it selected in the fromComboBox(this is the class with the bug in the actionPerformed method).

Note to self: 07/23
I was able to fix the big by using getSource() in the Handler action listener to do specific actions depending
on what is selected. For example, if I want to change the toComboBox depending on what is selected for fromComboBox,
then I check the getSource() to see if the JComponent that is interacted with it fromComboBox. That way I can
separate the actions of the fromComboBox and the convertButton. I also made a bunch of helper methods to
change the toComboBox, depending on what is selected on fromComboBox. Those helper method start with "from" and
proceed with the measurement (ie. fromKilo). I also made helper methods for the conversions to be made when
the button is pressed. What is left to do is add the panel with steps 1-3 on how to use the GUI and the
helper methods for Tablespoon and Teaspoon conversions. They're supposed to check if the decimal is equal to
common cooking measurements such as 1/2 teaspoons, 1/4 tablespoons, and so on, and output the fraction
instead of the decimal. Lastly, add a disclaimer by JOptionPane or something better when the user is trying
to convert from volume to weight. Before you start on all that, be sure to complete documentation to all the
new methods that were made on 07/23 (the day I'm writing this). You're almost done!
