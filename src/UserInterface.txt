Have two drop down menus. One will have the "from" conversion and the other will have a "to" conversion.
There will be a "convert" button that will make the conversion and make the "to" measurement show up in a textfield
Have a disclaimer when converting from weight to volume that says that conversion is from weight to volume so the
measurement will be an approximation. Make sure to catch any input/output exceptions or number format exceptions and
pop up a dialogue box when that is encountered.
